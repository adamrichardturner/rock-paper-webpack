# Rock Paper Webpack

This short project explores the build tool Webpack. To build this project, I utilized the following:

- Installed webpack as a npm package and other relevant dependancies.
- Configured package.json file to work with webpack scripts.
- Created and configured a webpack.config.js file to process relevant files (e.g. CSS, images, fonts)
- Bundled the project appropriately. 

## Getting Started

Clone the project, in the project root run:

### `npm install`

Then the following scripts are available, to view the project after build simply open index.html in the root directory.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `public` folder.
